  # Design

  ## Color Scheme

- I wanted to create a fun and colorful color scheme,which co ordinates with Ghibli films, while still keeping the site looking simplistic and clean. Because of this, i chose to stick to only two main colors that are based on the hero image on the landing page. It contains tones of royal blue and orange. Throughout the whole site, I have chosen to use dark blue, orange, and green. These fun colors stand out nicely against white backgrounds without appearing too much on the eye. They also portray the fun and magical feel that the Ghibli films offer to their fans.

  <img src="readme-docs/color-scheme.png">

- Dark navy blue (#1d438a) - This is one of the main primary colors of the site used alongside orange. It goes well with the website as it carries on the deep-sea theme that the hero image on the landing page conveys. It is used for: banners of information and image titles for ghibli posts.

- Coral Orange (#f4623a)- Taken from the hero image, this coral color is adapted a lot more throughout the site, being the primary color across the project. The contrast between blue and orange works nicely and goes hand in hand. It's used for: the logo, dividers underneath titles, URL buttons, hovering over nav sub-pages, and community post titles

- Green (#008000) and Red(#ff0000)- A hint of green and red are used on the profile page for the edit and delete buttons to stand out to the user as both buttons allow the user to manage their data.

## Logo

I had 3 main logos to choose from. All were based off of the origional studio ghibli logo but were more basic and simple, coresponding to the rest of the site. I ended up going with the first option as it went pretty well with the house colors of the site and stood out well against a white background on the navigation bar.

  <img src="readme-docs/logo.png">

## Typography

There are two fonts used throughout the site: "Merriweather" and "Merriweather-Sans"

  <img src="readme-docs/typography.png">
 
 - I wanted to use a combination of two fonts to not make the site boring and plain. "Merriweather-Sans" I used for big title texts and buttons as it's slightly thicker and bolder, whereas "Merriweather" is used for the text on posts and larger quantities of information.

## Imagery

- Images are an important part of the site as they are used to refer to the ghibli films and bring a magical and nostalgic feel to the site.They appear the most on the landing page to attract and show the site's visitors what the focus of the website is.

- Using high-quality images from Ghibli films keeps the ghibli aesthetic strong and attracts more users to the site, ultimately converting them into registered, active users. Images such as the hero image are used on the landing page, log in, logout, add and edit pages to keep the pages exciting and not bland.

  # Features

  ## Existing Features

  - A fully responsive website, can be viewed on any device.

  - buttons on the landing page persuading the user to browse theories and register

  - allowing users to create and manage their accounts

    - This includes editing and deleting their posts.

  - registered users can search the browse page for theories.

  - My site will include sub-pages such as Home, Browse, Add, Profile, login, logout, register

    - subpages such as browse, add, profile, and login will only be available to registered users that are signed into their account.

  - Once a user adds a theory and posts it, it is visible to the community on the browse page.

  - The browse page will include a section for theories posted by the web site's creator and another section posted by the community.

  #### Navigation Bar

  - The navigation bar will be simple and easy to use that turns into a hamburger menu when viewed on a small screen.
  - When the hamburger menu is clicked, a dropdown menu appears with the subpages. When the dropdown menu appears, the content below moves down allowing no content to be hidden underneath the navigation bar.

  #### Landing Page

  - A vibrant hero image with the website name will appear in big bold writing with a short and simple summary below. A button will be placed below for 'Browse Theories' to allow easy navigation. For unregistered users, this takes them to the register page and for registered users, this takes them to the browse page.

  - Below the hero image, a small section will appear with the title 'join the community and a register button, again, for easy navigation while making the signing up process easy and simple for the user.

  - There will be a 'sneak peak' section with a small number of theories that draw new users to the site and allows them to see what the website is all about. The theories that appear in this section are posted by the website creator.
    - When these are clicked on, a larger page appears with an enlarged image and text for the user to easily read. There is a close icon at the top of the page and a close button at the button.
  - Underneath this area, there is a small section with the title of 'want to see more?' that redirects users to the register page. The redirects to the register page persuade the user to signup to have full access to the website without any hassle.

  #### Browse Page

  - At the top of the browse page, there will be a search bar that will enable the user to search through the communities posts, the results will be filtered through the theory names and descriptions. Besides this is a 'clear' button allowing the search bar and results to be reset.
  - section below will be the theories that are posted by the website's creator which have a clear difference in styling.
  - When viewed on mobile, The posts appear on top of each other rather than beside each other, making it easier and more efficient to view on smaller devices.
  - The browse page is only visible to registered users so that posts are only seen within the community.

  #### Login, register, add post, edit post

  - The forms used on these pages are all the same, keeping the same aesthetic throughout the website.
  - The add and edit forms can be only be accessed by registered and authenticated users.

#### 404 page

- A custom 404 error page for when a user tries to access a page that doesn't fit their current state. e.g: the user attempts to register while being logged in. The 404 page has a link that takes them back to the home page and an image that fits well with the aesthetic of the website.

#### Profile

- The profile page will show the user's username alongside their posts while also giving them an option to add a post. Each of their posts will have an option to edit and delete. If the user chooses to delete the post, a modal pop appears asking the user again if they want to delete it. This is added for precaution just in case the user has clicked delete by accident. The profile page follows CRUD operations as it allows users to add, edit and delete their posts easily. Once posts are deleted, they are also removed from the browse section and will no longer be visible to the community
- When posts are added, edited, or deleted, flash messages will appear letting the user know that it has been successful

# The Database Model

For this project, I chose to use MongoDB for all database aspects to become more familiar with it through practice and development.MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.

- Using 12-bit-MongoDB-specific unique values such as ObjectId's can be used to identify objects within the Database as it is used by MongoDB to search for a specific ObjectID.This is used within my project for my site to run smoothly, allowing users to manage their data.

![database model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/130251989-16ea9f50-c077-48b8-b79a-80f0abd5940f.png)

Above, we have the posts collection that contains a user's post when added and the user's collection, containing login info. Within both collections, the ObjectID is present so that the data can be manipulated and the DB can be searched.

## Future Features

- Add like and dislike buttons to users posts, allowing the community to engage with one another
- Added newsletter signup that would send registered users the latest theories by email

<img src="readme-docs/browser.png">

- Responsively was used to view my site from various devices simultaneously, helping me spot any errors. The different devices varied from Galaxy Fold (280px) to large Desktop ViewPorts.

# Accessibilty

[Screenshots from Google Lighthouse's accessibility checker can be viewed here](https://github.com/laila-ba/Ghibli-Theories/tree/main/testing)

# Bugs

#### Listed below are some bugs I came across while building this project and how I resolved them:

1.  Making the forms responsive on mobile devices

    - The forms appeared nicely centered on desktop view however when the screen was smaller, the forms moved to the right and were out of view. I knew I had to add a media query to resolve the issue so I added :

             @media screen and (max-width:522px){
             .login-page{
             width:355px;
             }

    - Through this code, I wanted to make the form's width 355px until it was viewed on a larger screen however, this didn't seem to work. I did some debugging and realized that the code wasn't being read because there was an extra '}' above the code and it was being used. Once I removed the extra curly bracket, the media query was working and the form appeared centered on smaller devices, but it was moved to the left on the desktop.

    - Realizing that it hadnt worked, i then switched it around and added this which fixed the issue :

          @media screen and (min-width: 522px) {
          .login-page {
          width: 500px;
          }
          }

2.  Making sure user posts were appearing fine on the browser page

    - I had an issue where the user's posts were appearing inside each other's divs. Initially, I thought there was something wrong with the styling in CSS but after taking a look at the template, I had realized that the 'end for the element was meant to be appearing between the last two divs.
    - <details>
      <summary>When doing this, the issue was resolved and the posts were appearing in their separate boxes.</summary>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/130280439-ffced0de-eb69-4294-8fe4-6c803e9a561b.png">
      </details>

3.  The search bar on the browse page didn't let users click on it to write

- I had an issue where the search bar couldnt be clicked on, meaning something was blocking it. It took me a while to figure out however when looking at the CSS, i realised there was : pointer-events: none; being applied onto the class of the input field. Once this was removed, it was working fine.

# Deployment

## Local - Instructions to run the project on your local device using an IDE

1. Within the project repository, Download the files locally  by clicking the 'Code' button located in the top section of the repository. Then select 'Download ZIP' and unzip the files in the directory of your choice.
  
  <img src="readme-docs/code.png">

2. You can also Clone the repository instead by running the following command from your IDE

          gh repo clone laila-ba/Ghibli-Theories

3. After doing this, within your chosen IDE, make sure you are inside the project folder by using 

           cd The/Project/Folder/Path

4.  Activate virtual enviroment:
    - Python's venv source 
            .venv/bin/activate
    
    - Using Windows and macOS, .venv is the name you gave previously

5. Install all requirements from requirements.txt file

          pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  - After this, create a file named 'env.py' to store all environment variables like so:

          os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "")
          os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "")
          os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "")

6. Run the application

         python3 app.py

## Remote 

1. Set up a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account and create a new app.

2. Create the requirements.txt file to contain all dependencies

           pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

3. Create a Procfile

           echo web: python app.py > Procfile

4. Add your environment variables. This can be done by going to the 'Settings' tab and click 'Reveal Config Vars' and add the following variables

          IP <0.0.0.0>
          MONGO_DBNAME <ghibli_theories>
          MONGO_URI <mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-qtxun.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority>
          SECRET_KEY <your_secret_key>

5. Ensure that recent files have been added, committed and pushed to your GitHub repository

6. At the top of the heroku site, click on *Deploy*. Choose automatic deploys to your Github account and repo name. Once this is done, you can open the app.
